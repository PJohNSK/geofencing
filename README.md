### Program to model geofences in QGIS!
### Written / Complied together by Andrew Cutts www.acgeospatial.co.uk
### Python 2.7
### Stopwatch method adapted from http://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/26534/is-there-a-better-way-to-count-seconds-in-python

### Many thanks!

### Usage
### 1. Open blank QGIS project
### 2. Open python console
### 3. Set projection to British grid, EPSG code 277000
### 4. Use the map to x = 512915 y = 120728 (first coordinate to be plotted), I use Openstreetmap to zoom out a bit shots will increment 12.5m
### 5. Run the script (you could add the shapefile boundary if you want)
